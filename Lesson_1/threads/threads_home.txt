1. Indicate all dangerous lines of code in samples 4 and 5.
Why these points are dangerous in multi-threaded environment?

2. Figure out, where in samples 4 and 5 some synchronization
primitives should be added. What functions should be synchronized?
What kind of synchronization primitives could be used there?
